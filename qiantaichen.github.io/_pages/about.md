I am a second-year master student in Greenwich Lab of [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.fzu.edu.cn/)
at [Fuzhou University](https://yjsy.fzu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Meiqing Wang](https://math.fzu.edu.cn/info/1102/1837.htm) and [Prof. Fei Chen](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1203/5024.htm).

Before that, I received my B.S degree in [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.fzu.edu.cn/) at [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/) from 2017 to 2021, majoring in Information and Computing Science.

I have a broad interest in deep learning and computer vision. My research is mainly focused on **Action Detection** and **Temporal Action Localization**, especially on applying explainable deep learning techniques to handle spatio-temporal data to detect when and where an action performed and to analyse the boundary and the fine-grained multi-labels of an action.

Here are some repositories containing links primarily to conference publications about my relevant research:
